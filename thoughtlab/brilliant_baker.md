# The Brilliant Baker

Invented a process for baking tarts, then a whole selection of products made out of the tarts. Then, finally, the insight to use these products to create new metatarts.

This was the basis for Metatart Bakery. However, due to threat of litigation, the name was not available.

The baker, Jane, spent long hours in deliberation.

## The Local
Jack stood in the middle of the street, frowning with lifted eyebrows. The building in front of him had a new sign. It read: "Retart Bakers"

Restart? Maybe? But how could you make a whole sign and not notice. He got closer and saw the letters on the window matched the sign. Retart Barkers. Open Every Day. 7:30-6. Try our delicious re-tarts!
