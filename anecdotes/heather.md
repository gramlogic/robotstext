What I'm trying to say is like there was this woman standing in line behind me in on the sidewalk outside the theater when the fight broke out across the street. It was a group of black guys, local to this part of town, and one of them was losing badly. Lying on the ground in the gutter and getting kicked hard. My eye was on the doors of the theater, not yet open. It was 6:27. This woman was trying to talk to me about something that was not the fight and I kept looking over her shoulder to try to gauge how out of hand it was getting, as the crowd around this guy got bigger.

I'm sorry I said I'm kind of nervous about this situation and she was like what. She turned around and then looked back at me.

Why are you nervous she says. They just live here.

I check my watch. It's 6:28. Sorry, just a sec, I'm going to text my friend and see whether they can open a little early.

I mean OK, she says, laughing a little. Behind her a guy comes out of one of the doorways holding a baseball bat. There's a bunch of shouting.

I don't think there's anything to worry about, she says. I nod, texting. Like what actually are you worried about? Pointedly this time.

Uh, it's not. I start, give up. Like, it looks like some of those guys are getting hurt. I say. She turns around again.

Well if you're really that worried about it I'll just go talk to them.

That's OK I think they're going to open the theater.

It's not a big deal I'll be right back. Hold my spot OK?

This woman turns around and steps into the street, walks out into the middle of the fight like nothing is happening. The whole crowd stops and looks at her. She looks down at the guy lying on the street who isn't moving.

I can see her talking but she's out of earshot now. One of the guys is answering her. Everyone looks toward me for a moment. I look over at the door, then look back. She's walking back to the line.

He's just tired, she says. Nothing to worry about.

The doors open. I look back at the crowd, still all looking at us. We head in to the theater.

Another performance, years before. I'm in the bathroom wearing a tails suit. This guy from the bar comes up to use the urinal next to me, and starts talking to me.


And then the third one is Jefferson Lovely.
