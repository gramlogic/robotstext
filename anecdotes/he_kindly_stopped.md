He kindly stopped for me

The textbook for Barry Berg's English class was a large hardcover maroon book titled "Literature: Sound and Sense." It began with an example of a story that was not literature (The Greatest Game) and explained no further such stories would be included. The chapters were divided into a taxonomy of literary devices (alliteration, irony, metaphor, meter, simile,  etc.), and the actual stories and poems integrated as examples of how these devices were employed.

The chapter on metaphor began with a definition and a warning against the danger of confusing it with simile, which for some reason almost all textbooks seemed to agree was very important to avoid. It then went on to introduce 3 types of metaphors. In the first kind, both elements of the metaphor are explict; for example, "Fred is a pig," (but absolutely not "Fred eats like a pig," which is a _simile_). In the second kind, one element is implicit, as in: "Fred let out a short squeal when his bowl of stew arrived, then immediately set about grunting and rooting his way through it." In the third and most rare kind, both elements are implied. As an example, the textbook presented Emily Dickison's "It sifts from Leaden Sieves":

```
It sifts from Leaden Sieves -
It powders all the Wood.
It fills with Alabaster Wool
The Wrinkles of the Road -

It makes an even Face
Of Mountain, and of Plain -
Unbroken Forehead from the East
Unto the East again -

It reaches to the Fence -
It wraps it Rail by Rail
Till it is lost in Fleeces -
It deals Celestial Vail

To Stump, and Stack - and Stem -
A Summer's empty Room -
Acres of Joints, where Harvests were,
Recordless, but for them -

It Ruffles Wrists of Posts
As Ankles of a Queen -
Then stills it's Artisans - like Ghosts -
Denying they have been -
```

The question of what was being compared was left as an exercise to the reader, and so we discussed it in class. I suggested snow and death. Mr. Berg accepted the first one, but rejected the second. "Michael," he said, "I think if Dickison had been thinking about death the poem would have a somewhat more ominous tone, so that doesn't seem likely to me."

In retrospect, "time" is probably a better word for what Dickison is describing. Still, I think death is not too far off.

Years later I remembered that conversation while I was reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I was sitting on a bus in San Francisco. Harry and Dumbledore were crossing a subterranean lake of dead bodies put in place by Lorde Voldemort to frighten intruders away, and Dumbledore told Harry that Voldemort uses dead bodies because he finds them frightening. The cave had that ominous ambience that Berg had found to be absent in Dickinson's poem, and I finally realized what should have been obvious all along. 

Emily Dickison was not afraid of death.
