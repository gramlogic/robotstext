One day Farf did not eat any vegetables or fruit so he could not poop. He just keep eating bread and cheese and his body turned it into poop but it would not come out, so he filled all the way up with poop until finally he turned into a poop.

Oh no, said his parents. You turned into a poop.

Put me in the toilet! cried Farf.

Are you sure? said his parents.

Yes! said Farf. His parents looked worried but then Farf said, "I mean yes, please." So they put him in the toilet.

Now flush me! said Farf.

Are you sure? said his parents.

Yes! Flush, me please! he said. His parents were still worried about flushing him but he did say please so they flushed the toilet.

Farf rushed down the drain into the pipes beneath the house. He went through the pipes in the sewer, and followed the sewer all the way to the sewage treatment plant. Farf went through the sewage treatment plant and got filtered out back into water.

Wow, he said, that was not fun!

When he was finished being filtered his parents turned on the faucet at home and the filtered water with Farf in it came all the back through the pipes and out of the sink into a cup. Then his parents put the cup on the window sill and the water evaporated away in the sun, and there was Farf, inside the cup. He was the same as before but very tiny. His dad got the bicycle pump and pumped him back up until he was his regular size again.

After that he always remembered to eat his vegetables.
