When Farf was a tiny infant he moved himself around the world by yelling. His parents woke one night to find him crying over their bed, eyes clenched tight, face red, body hovering in the air about three feet above them. His father jumped up and put his hands underneath him, worried he might fall. But Farf remained stuck in the air, so he stood behind him instead and held him where he was. Comforted, Farf stopped crying and went back to sleep. His father felt his body gradually regain its normal weight. After a few moments he brought Farf back to the crib, and then fell back asleep himself, assuming he'd lost his mind.

But two hours later Farf was floating above them again, crying. His father and mother looked up at him from the bed. Uh, I think it's your turn, said his father. His mother gave his father a look and stood up. He's too high for me to nurse him, she said.

So his father got up and held him from behind again and his mother climbed onto the window-sill next to the bed. He would not come down or stop crying but his father was able to nudge him forward through the air to where his mother was standing and when he reached her he began to nurse and slowly settled down into her arms.
