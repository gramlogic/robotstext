Poof was a rabbit. One day she went down to the pond to get water. A storm began and she hid. In the reflection of the pond, she saw the moon and the wolf. 

When she returned to the burrow her parents were gone. The rabbits that were there were dumb. She found something on the loom from her grandmother, and took it with her.

In her dream she was back at the pond. A rabbit was looking at her from inside the water. It was bright white, luminescent. She was thirsty and her lips touched the water. As she drank the reflection moved toward her, like a skin on a soup, a floating tapestry. When she was finished there was no reflection at all, and the water rumbled inside her like a low growl. She woke to the scent of wolf hair.

The wolf catches her. Don't believe everything you read, he says.

The journey was very slow. Behind her the shadow of the wolf, stretching its jaws.

A hawk had a recurring nightmare of hunting a rabbit. In the dream, the rabbit is beautiful, but there is no way to stop the dive toward it. In the dream the rabbit says "something happened to me." The hawk wakes up just before.

One day there is a strange wind in the field that stops half way, and where it stops stands the rabbit from the dream. As if in the dream, the hawk dives, pulled toward it. She sees her reflection in the rabbit's eye. Trapped.

In the final moment, the rabbit is gone. There is a wind on the other side of the field.

That was when I saw you, the furious wings of your beating hard. I knew then you recognized me. And then you came.

The rabbit in the moon tells her where to find the giants. He gives her a mirror, and advice: you cannot bring the dead back to life. You can only bring life back to the dead. Even that is not easy.

She enters the silent forest and finds the taxidermist's cave, his garden, his pool of blood.

She paints the statues with the blood. The insects return.

She moves on to the photographer's lair. Photographs hang drying in the cave. His looks down at her over his glasses and attempts to take a picture. She won't stay still, and the image is blurred.

He kicks her against the wall. She cries, small at first, then louder. Agony and despair, then anger. The sound resonates in the cave and rises out into the sky, a sad, strong howl. The moon emerges and brightens, penetrating and washing out the red light of the cave. The photographs fade to white, and the shadow of the rabbit leaps forward over the wall. The photographer steps back. Their shadows in this pose burn into the wall. Then the moon is gone, shrouded by a cloud, and with it, Poof.
