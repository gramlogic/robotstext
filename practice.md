What does everyone else do?
I think they probably buy them online.
A circular log. But, it doesn't overwrite. I just mean it's append-only. I guess not circular.
Your friends get all their information from famous experts. You realize you're going to have to become famous if you want your friends to listen to you again.

At some point in the middle of the pandemic a bobcat starting visiting my back yard.At first I thought it was a neighborhood cat but then it stretched out and put its forepaws on my back fence post, about 4 feet high. It's back legs were still on the ground. I was Zooming my friend and I remembered this might be interesting to people. I saw a bobcat in my yard yesterday, I said.
It wasn't a bobcat, he told me. They aren't active at that time of time in your area.
He lives on the other coast and has a degree in musicology. I really think it was a bobcat, I say.
It was just a tabby cat, he says. 100 percent.
OK I'm not a bobcat expert but 100 percent seems high. growing up, I had two cats and I feel I'm roughly familiar with their shape and size.
That night I find a bobcat enthusiast forum online. There's a Google map layer where people tag sightings. My neighborhood is covered in little bobcat icons.

Did you get a picture? he asks.
No, I say.
